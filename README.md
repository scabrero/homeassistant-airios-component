Home Assistant component that allows you to control and monitor ventilation units and accessories from different manufacturers.

Airios develops and produces components for residential ventilation systems that final manufacturers use to build their products upon, from controller boards to remote controls or sensors. These components communicate over a proprietary RF protocol from Honeywell called Ramses II in the 868Mhz band.

> [!WARNING]
> This integration is not affiliated in any way with Airios nor any final manufacturer, the developers take no responsibility for anything that happens to your devices because of this library.


## Prerequisites

An RF bridge is needed for Home Assistant to access the RF network. There are two bridge models with different interfaces. The Airios BRDG-02R13 has a RS485 serial interface (Modbus-RTU) and the BRDG-02EM23 is an Ethernet device (Modbus-TCP). The final manufacturers use to rebrand and rename these devices.

- Before you can use this integration, make sure you have the RS485 serial bridge. The Ethernet device is not supported.

Please check the [bridge documentation page](doc/1-brdg02r13.md) for more information.

## Installation

### HACS

1. Add the repository as a [custom repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories) in HACS. Type `scabrero/homeassistant-airios-component` in `Repository`, choose `integration` type.
2. Search the Airios integration in HACS, click Download
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. [Add Airios integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=airios_ventilation), or go to Settings > Integrations and add Airios

### Manual

1. Download [the latest release](https://github.com/scabrero/homeassistant-airios-component/releases)
2. Extract the `custom_components` folder to your Home Assistant's config folder, the resulting folder structure should be `config/custom_components/airios_ventilation`
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. [Add Airios integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=airios_ventilation), or go to Settings > Integrations and add Airios

## Options

### Seconds between scans

Data polling interval. **Don't set this below 30 seconds**.

All data from ventilation units and accessories bound to the bridge is fetched together.

## Entities

You can expect these entities (fan name can vary, here "DF Optima2"):

### Debugging

When debugging or reporting Issues, turn on debug logging using the three dots menu in the Airios integration pane.

When you next deactivate debug logging (in a browser), a debug log file will appear in Downloads.
Attach it as is to your issue (drop it on the edit pane).
